Light is a common element in our lives. Natural and artificial light have direct influence in our daily activities. The use of light in an artistic way can change the way we perceive the spaces around us. 

The effects of interaction of light are visual and mental stimuli that can be at the same time intriguing and entertaining to the users of a space.

Below, some examples of interactive uses of light are listed in order to create a visual archive for the project.

Created by Japanese artist Takahiro Matsuo in collaboration with architect Akihisa Hirata, the Aquatic Colors installation may be an exploration through light, projections and architecture, but it is the interaction that will truly win people over. As people mill about closer or farther away from the walls of the Aquatic Colors installation, the number of jellyfish increase or decrease.

Designed by Etsy user 8 bit lit, the Super Mario Coin Block Pendant Lamp is made of laser-cut plexiglass and lit by energy-efficient LEDs. Hung from the ceiling or from an acrylic stand, this custom-made light fixture is so bright, its glow is even evident during the day time. The user must punch (or simply touch) the bottom of the block to turn the lamp on. The lamp also makes the classic coin noise from the game.

The GS Caltex Pavilion at EXPO 2012 was designed by Atelier Brückner studio. Located in the South Korean city of Yeosu, this awe-inspiring pavilion is gaining global attention.

The 2000-sq-m site has been created to represent a Korean oil company and is made up of 380 vertical elements that sway in the wind. The grass-like elements are placed side by side to resemble a rice field that is lit up at nightfall.

These poles are touch-sensitive, transforming their color tone and opacity. Atelier Bruckner's Prof. Uwe R. takes inspiration from nature's flow of energy, ensuring bold aesthetics that stay true to the sustainable oil brand. The GS Caltex Pavillion at EXPO 2012 is alluring and interactive, creating a memorable spatial experience for its many users.

The Cinimod Studio Tunnel boasts interactive illumination. The colors and positioning of the lighting is determined by a moving installation within the tunnel. This piece reacts to visitors with the detection by thermal camera control. When each user passes through, the beams of light change and illuminate according to their movement. The light installation changes color patterns and positioning depending on the number of visitors in the tunnel. 

As color is perceived on the white bands above, the tunnel boasts "an ambient lighting effect that represents the overall ebb and flow of the day’s visitors" according to Dominic Harris of Cinimod Studio. This interactive light display is groundbreaking in its responsive nature and interesting with its showcase of light-based art installation.
