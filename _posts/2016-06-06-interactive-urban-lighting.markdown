A researcg made in the UC Berkeley studied interactive urban lights system focused on increasing positive affect among pedestrians. Their efforts were three-fold. First, the design, construction, and evaluation of an efficient interactive lighting system focused on wellbeing, as opposed to systems focused on utility or landscaping. Second, the use of scientific methods to discover basic design parameters for affective outcomes. Third, they  optimized user experiences for low energy profiles, positive affect, and interactivity. Tested interactions show positive and some unexpected negative responses. Optimal interactive designs cut energy consumption by 75% while maintaining positive affect. Furthermore, card sorting design exercises revealed an inverse relationship between perceived pleasant feelings and interactivity.
