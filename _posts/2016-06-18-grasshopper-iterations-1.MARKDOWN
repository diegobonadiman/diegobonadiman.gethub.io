In order to generate the form for the intervention, I collected the data of solar incidence in chicago to use as a parameter in Grasshopper to manipulate the shape and size of the object.

The following iterations were the results of the manipulation of the number of rows in Grasshopper.

Using these parameters and components in Grasshopper, the results are all plane, the next step is to change the components to create a surface for the object.
