The focus of the research now is the light reacting to movement and its applications. In order to create a visual and conceptual archive for the research, following there are two more examples of use of light. 

<b>Audi's swarm tail light</b>

A concept presented by Audi in 2013 shows a technology that can make the back of cars display bright patterns to other drivers. This 'swarm' is made up of thousands of small red lights that cover the width of the boot and react to movements of the car.

When the driver turns the wheel, the red dots flow in the direction it has been turned.  When the car speeds up the number of dots, or 'fish', increase and they flow faster around the surface. When the driver brakes, the dots slow down and flow forward onto the top of the boot.

Swarm technology is made up of thousands of organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs).  These small points of red light flicker and move like a swarm of fish. The movements of the red dots follow the movements of the vehicle.  When a right turn is made, they flow to the right. When the driver brakes, the dots flow  forward. The faster the car goes, the faster the dots move.

<b>The Pool - Jen Lewin Studio</b>

The installation is composed of 106 interactive platforms, set up in a larger circular form. The pads communicate wirelessly and react with each other based on user interactions. Visitors can control which lights are illuminated by stepping, jumping, leaning, and bouncing on top of the pads. Foot location, pressure, and speed determine the intensity and patterns of color, and as a person moves, light radiates out in all directions.

The author says:

<i>"POOL verb = combine, amalgamate, blend, join forces, league, merge, put together, share

The Pool is an environment of giant, concentric circles created from interactive circular pads. By entering The Pool, you enter a world where play and collaborative movement create swirling effects of light and color. Imagine a giant canvas where you can paint and splash light collaboratively. As multiple users play in The Pool, their interactions become mesmerizing patterns of shifting and fading colors.

Since 2012 alone, The Pool has traveled to over 30 major installations worldwide, and has clocked millions of user steps."</i>
