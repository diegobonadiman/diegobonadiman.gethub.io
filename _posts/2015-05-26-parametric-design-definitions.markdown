Parametric is a term used in a variety of disciplines from mathematics through to design. Literally it means working within parameters of a defined range. It originates from mathematics by the parametrics equations and refers to the use of certain parameters or variables that can be edited to manipulate or alter the end result of an equation or system. _Parametric design_ is a term used to define the processes based on algorithmic analysis that allows the expression of parameters and rules that, assembled, define, encode and clarify the relationship between design purposes and design responses.
