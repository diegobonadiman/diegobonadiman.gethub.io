Light is an architectural element. The comprehension and perception of the built space is directly related to the way light interacts with it.

Light is responsible to give the user of a space the ability to distinguish physical forms, dimensions, but can also stimulate diverse visual sensations, experiences and moods. Light can improve or destroy a good design and its action plays a fundamental role in different evaluations of quality in architecture. 

Energy or visible radiation are the common definition of light. The human vision is the perception determined by this radiation and our visual system is the physical and psychological tool that process the information provided by it.

The visual comprehension of a space depends on spatiality, atmosphere and visibility. Spatiality refers to physical and measurable aspects of a room such as distance, volume, orientation and proportion. The quality of a light source can make the volume be perceived as huge or small, open or congested. Atmosphere is the general character of a place and is associated with the mental and emotional aspects of light. Visibility is related to work issues and the potential to see things while completing a task such as texture and color.

All these items are well known for natural light and traditional artificial light, but how can digital fabrication affect the spatial, technical and psychological aspects of artificial lighting? That is one of the questions that my research topic aims to respond.
